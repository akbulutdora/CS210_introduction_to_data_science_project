# CS210_introduction_to_data_science_project
Worked on the TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset as a group to build a movie recommendation engine. This project was done as a part of the Introduction to Data Science Course at SabancÄ± University at Fall 2020.

Many movie streaming platforms devise movie-recommendation systems in order to serve their customers better, and make them spend more time on the platform. Also, the users wish to find movies that they will like. In our project, we aim to build a movie recommendation system based on the database. Because we do not have user-specific information, we are planning to make recommendations based on the content, genre, and language. Several factors we are going to consider are popularity, actors, runtime, revenue, keywords in the description, etc.
